# Credit_Card_Approval_Predictions
Machine Learning Project

* Developed an automatic credit card approval predictor using machine learning techniques, specifically Logistic Regression, with Python on Google Colab.
* Loaded and viewed the dataset, identifying a mixture of numerical and non-numerical features, varying value ranges, and missing entries.
* Preprocessed the dataset to handle missing values and normalize features, ensuring optimal model performance.
* Conducted exploratory data analysis to build insights and guide model development.
* Built and trained a machine learning model to predict the acceptance of credit card applications based on the preprocessed data.
